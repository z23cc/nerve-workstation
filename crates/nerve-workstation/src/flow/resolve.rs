//! Worker resolution + small pure helpers for the [`Driver`](super::driver::Driver).
//!
//! Split out of `driver.rs` for the file-size convention: this module holds the
//! [`WorkerResolver`] seam (how a declarative [`WorkerRef`] becomes a runnable
//! [`AgentWorker`]) and the strategy/result helper functions the driver folds
//! with. All pure — no engine state, no nondeterminism.
