//! The deterministic orchestration engine (Wave C1).
//!
//! This is the conductor the orchestration design
//! (`docs/designs/agent-orchestration.md` §3) calls for: a **pure interpreter**
//! over a recorded worker tape. The control flow is a deterministic function of
//! `(WorkflowDef, recorded WorkerResults)`; the only nondeterminism — each
//! worker's events, usage, cost, and timing — is captured into the
//! [`WorkerLedger`](crate::worker::WorkerLedger) (§5). So an orchestration run is
//! reproducible regardless of which worker finishes first.
//!
//! ## The pieces
//!
//! - [`engine::step`] — the pure interpreter: `(FlowState, WorkflowDef, ledger)`
//!   → `Vec<Action>`. C1 interprets `Strategy::Single` + `Strategy::Parallel`.
//! - [`driver::Driver`] — applies [`Action`]s by minting workers through the C0
//!   [`WorkerFactory`](crate::worker::WorkerFactory), recording every
//!   [`WorkerEvent`](crate::worker::WorkerEvent) / [`TurnResult`] into the ledger,
//!   then re-running `step` until [`Action::Terminate`].
//! - The fan-out primitive is the **already-built**
//!   [`bounded_fan_out`](crate::subagent) — REUSED verbatim, preserving INPUT
//!   ORDER, which is the determinism invariant behind the declared-order fold.
//!
//! ## ZERO protocol commitment (C1)
//!
//! The engine is driven only by a hidden `nerve flow run` CLI subcommand
//! (`commands::flow`). It adds NO `RuntimeCommand`/`RuntimeEvent` vocabulary; C2
//! lands the `flow.*` protocol on top of this hardened engine.
