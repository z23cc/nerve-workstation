//! Daemon execution of `flow.replay` (Wave C4) — the audit verb (design §3/§4).
//!
//! Split out of [`flow_job`](super) for the file-size convention. This loads a
//! recorded flow (def + ledger) from the [`FlowStore`] by [`LedgerRef`] and re-runs
//! the SAME deterministic engine in REPLAY mode: a [`ReplayResolver`] hands every
//! node a `ReplayWorker` that re-emits the recorded events/results instead of
//! touching an LLM/subprocess, so the re-emitted `flow_*` event stream is
//! byte-identical to the recorded run, at zero cost. No budget, no live approver, no
//! persistence (replay reads the tape, never writes a new one).
