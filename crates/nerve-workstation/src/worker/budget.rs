//! Per-flow budget governance (Wave C3b) — design §6 + §8.
//!
//! Two cooperating pieces, both deterministic and replayable:
//!
//! 1. [`BudgetLedger`] — a PURE FOLD over recorded [`TurnResult`] usage/cost. The
//!    engine debits each finished node into it; because it folds RECORDED usage,
//!    a replay reproduces the same running totals byte-identically (golden-
//!    testable, like the [`WorkerLedger`](super::WorkerLedger) tape it shadows).
//!    It generalizes [`CostTelemetryHook`](crate::cost::CostTelemetryHook): the
//!    hook watches a single run's `Usage` events and cancels on a USD overrun; the
//!    `BudgetLedger` aggregates the WHOLE flow tree's usage and additionally caps
//!    total tokens.
//!
//! 2. [`FleetBudget`] — the spawn-control envelope (design §8): `{ depth,
//!    max_depth, live_workers, max_workers, remaining_usd, remaining_tokens }`.
//!    Before the engine starts a node it asks [`FleetBudget::may_spawn`]; at the
//!    depth/worker/budget ceiling it refuses (absence-at-floor — a deterministic,
//!    RECORDED refusal, not a crash). A [`WorkerSemaphore`] bounds `max_workers`
//!    across the whole tree (ureq is thread-per-worker).
//!
//! Monotone capability de-escalation (design §6/§8): [`BudgetGrant::intersect`]
//! carves a child node's grant from its parent by INTERSECTING — a child can only
//! NARROW, never widen, the parent's autonomy/budget. A contract test pins this.
//!
//! ## Scope (C3b)
//!
//! This module is FLOW-SCOPED. It governs the engine's own spawn path; it does
//! NOT touch the shipped `delegate_agent` / `spawn_agent` tool guards (the §8
//! guard-unification is a deferred cleanup). Budgeting of a worker that reports no
//! usage (the `gemini` recipe is UNVERIFIED) is WORST-CASE / fail-closed: see
//! [`BudgetLedger::debit`].
