//! C0 (keystone): the unified `AgentWorker` host port.
//!
//! Two unrelated halves drive AI work in this binary today: the external-CLI
//! delegation path ([`delegate_live`](crate::delegate_live) + the persistent
//! `DelegateSession`/`CodexSession` drivers) and the in-process provider path
//! ([`subagent`](crate::subagent)'s `SubAgentSpawner::run_at_depth` over an
//! `Orchestrator`). This module introduces the single missing abstraction the
//! orchestration design (`docs/designs/agent-orchestration.md` §2) calls for: a
//! **lifecycle** worker port that BOTH halves implement, so the future conductor
//! engine (C1) sees only `AgentWorker` and is worker-kind-agnostic.
//!
//! ## Additive by construction
//!
//! C0 is a NEW module that *wraps* the shipped mechanisms — it does not modify the
//! `delegate_*` / `subagent` / `agent` code paths. [`CliWorker`] reuses the
//! persistent delegate drivers ([`DelegateSession`](crate::delegate_session)/
//! [`CodexSession`](crate::delegate_session_codex)) and the gemini one-shot
//! launcher recipe; [`ProviderWorker`] reuses `SubAgentSpawner::run_at_depth`
//! under the SAME outermost `PolicyToolBox` gate. Every existing test stays green
//! without edits.
//!
//! ## The property the port buys (design §2)
//!
//! Both families emit the **same `WorkerEvent` stream** (`Step` of the existing
//! [`nerve_runtime::AgentEventKind`], plus a raw `Progress` line for opaque CLIs)
//! and raise approvals through the **same** [`DelegateApprover`](crate::delegate_proxy::DelegateApprover)
//! hub. So the engine, the [`WorkerLedger`], and every client are kind-agnostic —
//! [`WorkerKind`] is the only place the CLI-vs-provider distinction is visible.
//!
//! ## What is stubbed for C1 (honest partials)
//!
//! - [`BudgetGrant`] is a minimal placeholder: its fields are recorded but **not
//!   enforced** here. C3 wires the `FleetBudget` debit/cancel loop.
//! - [`WorkerLedger`] is a minimal append-only seq-numbered tape (events +
//!   results). C1 extends it to the full replay-tape / blackboard / persistence
//!   record (design §5).
//! - The [`WorkerFactory`] holds the shared deps and mints workers, but C0 does
//!   NOT rewrite `delegate_agent` / `spawn_agent` to call it (additive-only).
//!
//! C0 is additive: the port + workers exist and are tested, but the C1 engine is
//! their first production caller, so the public surface is dead until C1 lands.
