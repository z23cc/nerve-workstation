//! [`WorkerRegistry`] — worker-as-data (Wave C6, the P3 "loaded, not compiled" seam).
//!
//! C0's [`WorkerFactory`](super::WorkerFactory) maps a concrete [`WorkerKind`] to a
//! boxed [`AgentWorker`]. C6 adds the missing data layer above it: a declarative
//! [`WorkerDef`] discovered from disk and a [`WorkerRegistry`] that resolves a
//! [`WorkerRef::Named`](nerve_runtime::WorkerRef) through it. So "add any worker" is
//! a DATA change — drop a `<name>.json` in `.nerve/workers/` — with no recompile,
//! exactly the discipline [`Capabilities`](crate::capabilities) already uses for
//! agent-defs + skills (architecture north star P3, design §3/§6).
//!
//! ## Discovery precedence (project > global > built-in)
//!
//! [`WorkerRegistry::discover`] mirrors [`Capabilities::discover`] verbatim: a
//! precedence-ordered set of base directories (project `<root>/.nerve` before global
//! `config_home()`), each holding a `workers/` subdirectory of `<name>.json` files,
//! falling back to embedded built-in defaults (the bare `cli{codex|claude}`
//! refs, so existing inline workflows keep working unchanged). The first match wins;
//! a project def shadows a global one shadows a built-in.
//!
//! ## JSON only (offline-safe, matching `Capabilities`)
//!
//! Defs are JSON (`<name>.json`), the same choice [`Capabilities`] makes "to avoid
//! adding a YAML dependency (the build stays offline-safe)". The C6 brief mentioned
//! `{json,toml}`; we deliberately keep the existing JSON-only convention rather than
//! pull in a `toml` dependency the workspace does not otherwise carry — the loader
//! pattern is the load-bearing reuse, not the file extension.
//!
//! ## Security before openness (design §6/§9)
//!
//! A def may declare an exec-tier `remote` / `mcp` worker (design §10 C6). Resolving
//! such a def is allowed, but the [`WorkerFactory`](super::factory) refuses to MINT
//! it unless the fleet was explicitly opened (the same `--allow-delegate` posture a
//! CLI worker passes) — the registry never widens authority, it only names workers.
