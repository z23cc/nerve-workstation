//! [`WorkerFactory`] — the registry the flow engine calls to mint workers.
//!
//! Holds the shared deps both substrates need (the delegate launcher + codex MCP
//! allowlist for [`CliWorker`]s; the runtime / provider registry / gate / max-depth
//! for [`ProviderWorker`]s) and maps a [`WorkerRef`] to a boxed [`AgentWorker`].
//! This is the single seam the conductor resolves workers through.
//!
//! ## C6: worker-as-data + remote/MCP adapters
//!
//! The factory consults a [`WorkerRegistry`] so a [`WorkerRef::Named`] resolves to a
//! discovered [`WorkerDef`] (project > global > built-in, "loaded, not compiled") —
//! the engine still only ever sees an [`AgentWorker`]. A def may name a
//! [`RemoteWorker`] or [`McpWorker`]; those are EXEC-TIER and **refused-by-default**:
//! the factory mints them only when the fleet was explicitly opened (`allow_remote`,
//! mirroring `--allow-delegate`) — security before openness (design §6/§9).
