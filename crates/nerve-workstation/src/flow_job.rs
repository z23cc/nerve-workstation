//! Daemon execution of the `flow.*` command family (Wave C2).
//!
//! This is the host-layer composition that runs the deterministic C1 flow engine
//! ([`crate::flow`]) as a cancellable daemon **job** over the additive runtime
//! protocol (agent-orchestration design §4). It is the flow analogue of
//! [`crate::jobs`]'s `delegate.*` / `session.*` execution: a `flow.start` job runs
//! one [`Driver`](crate::flow::Driver) to completion in its job thread, mapping the
//! engine's worker events + node lifecycle onto the `flow_*` [`RuntimeEvent`]s; the
//! `job_id` IS the `flow_id`. `flow.get` / `flow.list` / `flow.close` mirror the
//! session/job equivalents through a live-flow registry, and `flow.respond` reuses
//! the existing [`ApprovalHub`] round-trip keyed by `flow_id` — exactly the
//! delegate/session pattern, no new approval mechanism.
//!
//! Determinism: the engine is pure; this module is the (nondeterministic) host
//! boundary that mints workers, streams events, and tracks live flows. It adds
//! NOTHING to `nerve-core`.
