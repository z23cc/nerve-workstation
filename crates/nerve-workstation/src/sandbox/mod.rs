//! `SandboxLauncher` — the containment seam for agent command execution.
//!
//! Execution is the agent's highest-risk capability, so the *containment* story
//! is a first-class seam rather than an inline `Command::spawn`. A
//! [`SandboxLauncher`] answers a single question — *"what may this process
//! reach?"* (cwd, filesystem, network, environment, time, output size) — and is
//! deliberately independent of the P4 authorization gate (`policy.rs`), which
//! answers *"is the caller allowed to run this at all?"*. The two compose: a
//! call must pass the gate **and** then run contained.
//!
//! This lives entirely in `nerve-workstation` (never `nerve-core`): execution is
//! non-deterministic, so it stays out of the golden-tested kernel. The port is
//! pure data plus one trait, so a stronger backend can land without touching any
//! caller. See `docs/designs/agent-exec-sandbox.md`.
//!
//! Backends: [`ProcessLauncher`] (MVP — best-effort "trusted local dev"
//! containment) and [`RefuseLauncher`] (daemon / remote — refuses outright).
//!
//! Deferred (future seams, intentionally NOT here): Linux Landlock/seccomp and
//! cgroups, macOS App-Sandbox bundle, microVM/WASM isolation, shell-mode
//! (pipes/redirects), and the daemon approval round-trip. The unused
//! `fs_read`/`fs_write`/`net` policy fields below are the data contract those
//! strong backends will enforce — carried now so the seam is stable.

// The containment policy is the seam's stable data contract: several fields
// (filesystem scoping, network posture) are consumed only by the deferred
// strong backends, not the MVP `ProcessLauncher`. Mirrors `checkpoint.rs` /
// `memory.rs`, which also predeclare their not-yet-wired surface.
