//! `PersistentChild` — the live, multi-turn variant of a contained spawn.
//!
//! [`super::SandboxLauncher::launch_streaming`] runs one command to completion and
//! reaps it; this is the *steerable* shape (DA-5a): the child stays alive across
//! turns and reads further input from an **open** stdin, exiting only when that
//! stdin reaches EOF (the close/cancel path). The handle therefore exposes three
//! things the one-shot path does not: a stdin writer kept open between turns, a
//! stdout line stream a reader thread feeds continuously, and explicit
//! kill/reap controls (no wall-clock timeout — a live session is bounded by the
//! caller's close, not a single command's clock).
//!
//! The same containment as [`super::ProcessLauncher`] applies — forced cwd,
//! env-clear + scrubbed allowlist, isolated process group — because the child is
//! spawned through the shared [`super::process::spawn_child`] helper.
