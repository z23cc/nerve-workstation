# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Nerve Workstation is a deterministic, pure-Rust code-intelligence engine exposed through two
runtime adapters over the **same** engine: an agent-facing **MCP server over stdio**, and
**`nerve daemon`**, a local runtime for human-facing frontends. The single binary is `nerve`.

## Commands

```bash
# Build
cargo build                                   # whole workspace
cargo build -p nerve-workstation --bin nerve  # just the nerve binary

# Test (default features). The semantic engine is behind a feature flag:
cargo test --workspace
cargo test -p nerve-core --features semantic            # exercises embeddings/ANN/rerank
cargo test --workspace golden_build_context             # run a single test by name substring

# Golden snapshots (insta) — after an *intentional* change to tool output:
cargo insta test --review                               # or: cargo insta accept

# CI gates (all enforced; clippy runs with -D warnings)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo clippy -p nerve-core --all-targets --features semantic -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all --check
./Scripts/check-file-size.sh                            # files <= 600 non-test lines (hard gate)

# Runtime protocol: Rust types in nerve-runtime are the source of truth for the TS types
bun run protocol:generate    # regenerate docs/protocol/* + packages/tui TS after changing protocol types
bun run protocol:check       # fail if Rust schema and generated TS have drifted (CI)

bun run check                # parallel TS + Rust + protocol checks
bun run tui:smoke            # build nerve, smoke-test the TUI backend against the daemon

# Run the engine (note: --root is mandatory; see fail-closed below)
cargo run -p nerve-workstation --bin nerve -- mcp serve --root /abs/path/to/project
cargo run -p nerve-workstation --bin nerve -- daemon --stdio --root /abs/path/to/project
```

Building requires a C toolchain — the 11 tree-sitter grammars compile `parser.c`.
Frontend scripts use Bun (`packageManager: bun@1.3.14`).

## Using the nerve MCP (this project's own tools)

When the `mcp__nerve__*` tools are connected, prefer them over raw grep/cat for
symbol- and structure-level work on this codebase — they are snapshot-backed and
deterministic (same input → same output). If they aren't connected, register the
locally built binary: `cargo build -p nerve-workstation --bin nerve` then
`./target/debug/nerve install --claude --root "$(pwd)"`.

Which tool to reach for:

| Task | Tool |
|---|---|
| Find a known string / identifier | `file_search` (path+content, BM25; `mode`, `include`/`exclude`/`extensions`, `output_mode`) |
| Skim a big file without reading it whole | `read_file` `view="summary"` (signatures kept, bodies elided, with re-read ranges) |
| Read exact lines | `read_file` with `start_line`/`end_line` (or `snap="block"` to round to a syntactic block) |
| "What's in this file / crate" | `get_code_structure` (signatures + fields + per-file token_count) |
| "Which files are central" | `get_repo_map` (deterministic PageRank; seed with `query` or `seed_paths`) |
| "Where is X defined / who calls it / how is it wired" | `goto_definition`, `find_references`, `call_hierarchy` |
| Structural match/rewrite text search can't express | `ast_search`, `ast_edit` (tree-sitter `query` mode **or** `$META` pattern mode) |
| "Find code about <concept>" (don't know the name) | `semantic_search` (hybrid dense+BM25+rerank) |
| Edit files | `edit` (`replace`/`patch`/`apply_patch`/`hashline`), `write`, `delete`, `move` |
| Assemble a working set for a question | `build_context`, then `manage_selection` / `workspace_context` |
| Read-only history | `git` (`status`/`diff`/`log`/`blame`/`show`) |

Usage notes that bite if you don't know them:
- **Workspace routing:** pass `workspace` when more than one workspace is registered, or the call
  errors as ambiguous. Numeric params also accept integer-valued strings (`"limit": "120"`).
- **Hashline edits:** call `read_file view="hashline"` first to get the `[PATH#TAG]` header and
  1-based line numbers, then `edit mode="hashline"`. A stale tag is rejected with `StaleHash` +
  `reread_hint` — re-read with `view="hashline"` and retry. `edit` returns a unified diff + syntax
  diagnostics and is root-gated.
- **Semantic freshness:** `semantic_search` returns `index_state` (`ready` / `warming` / `bm25_only`)
  plus a snapshot `generation`. The first call may be BM25-only while the dense index warms in the
  background — re-query for the upgraded hybrid results. The tool only exists when the server was
  built `--features semantic` (the default `cargo build` / `nerve install` binary omits it; first
  semantic use downloads a ~300 MB model).
- **Fail-closed:** without `--root`, catalog/read/search are refused. The xAI/Grok tools are out of
  scope for code work here.

## Architecture

Four Rust crates form a layered seam (`nerve-core` → {`nerve-runtime`, `nerve-agent`} → `nerve-workstation`); the TS frontend is a client of the top layer, not the engine. The long-term seam/plugin model and the binding invariants live in `docs/designs/architecture-north-star.md` — read it before any structural change.

- **`crates/nerve-core`** — the engine, intentionally host-agnostic. All filesystem access goes
  through the `CatalogProvider` port (`port.rs`); operations run against immutable
  `CatalogSnapshot` values (`snapshot.rs`). This snapshot-centered design is *why* the
  lexical/structural tools are deterministic and golden-testable. Tools live here
  (search, read, tree, `codemap`, `repomap`, `navigate`, `edit`, `semantic`, `build_context`).
  The transport-neutral MCP dispatch entry point is `dispatch/` (`handle_tool_call*` in
  `dispatch/mod.rs`): it takes a JSON `tools/call` params object and returns a JSON result.
  Core errors are `NerveError`; dispatch surfaces `DispatchError`.

- **`crates/nerve-runtime`** — the runtime seam above the engine: a `WorkspaceResolver` plus
  optional capability adapters (`RuntimeToolAdapter`) plus the job/event protocol.
  **This crate's Rust types are the source of truth for the runtime protocol** (Protocol v3 —
  a JSON-RPC 2.0 subset over newline-delimited JSON). The `export-runtime-protocol` bin emits the
  schema/constants; `packages/tui/scripts/generate-protocol.ts` derives the TS types from them.
  Any change to protocol types must be followed by `bun run protocol:generate`.

- **`crates/nerve-agent`** — the LLM agent layer (sibling of `nerve-runtime`; depends only on
  `nerve-core`): the `LlmProvider` trait + Anthropic/OpenAI-Responses/xAI adapters, multi-provider
  OAuth + the single credential store (`auth/`), and the `Orchestrator` tool-use loop. It reaches
  tools only through the `ToolBox` port — never the runtime/protocol directly. Synchronous (ureq).

- **`crates/nerve-workstation`** — the `nerve` binary: two adapters over the one engine.
  1. **MCP over stdio** (`server.rs`): agent-facing, pins MCP `protocolVersion` `2024-11-05`,
     and is **fail-closed** — with no `--root`, catalog/read/search are refused.
  2. **`nerve daemon`** (`daemon/`): frontend-facing local runtime that executes commands as
     cancellable in-memory **jobs** (`jobs.rs`); job state disappears when the daemon exits.
  Also: the CLI (`cli.rs` — `mcp serve` / `daemon` / `agent` / `config` / `warm` / `auth` / `cache` /
  `install`), the agent wiring (`agent.rs` — `RuntimeToolBox` bridging `Runtime`→`ToolBox`, plus
  `nerve agent run/login`), the xAI/Grok tools (`xai/`), and the xAI-only `nerve auth` alias
  (`auth/`, a thin adapter over `nerve-agent::auth`, which now owns all provider credentials).

- **`packages/tui`** — TypeScript backend/client that speaks the daemon runtime protocol.
- **`crates/nerve-wasm/pkg/`** — gitignored wasm-pack output, not a source crate.

### Things that aren't obvious from a single file

- **Determinism & parity.** Lexical/structural tools yield identical output for identical input,
  pinned by golden snapshots in `crates/nerve-core/tests/snapshots/*.snap` (insta). Behavioral
  differences vs. RepoPrompt are tracked in `docs/parity/` (`captures.json` is historical recorded
  I/O — treat it as a fixture, not editable config).
- **Semantic search is opt-in.** It is gated behind the `semantic` cargo feature (default build is
  OFF): local ONNX embeddings (`fastembed`) + ANN (`hnsw_rs`) + cross-encoder rerank, RRF-fused with
  BM25. First semantic use downloads a ~300 MB model **once per machine**; the index is persisted
  **per project**. Don't trigger it in tests/CI unless you mean to.
- **Two providers.** `MemoryCatalogProvider` (in-memory) backs most tests; `FsCatalogProvider` is the
  real filesystem provider. Codemap parses are cached by `(mtime, size)`.

## Conventions (CI-enforced — see `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`, `clippy.toml`)

- **Functions ≤ 100 lines** (`clippy::too_many_lines`, denied) and **nesting ≤ 6**
  (`clippy::excessive_nesting`, denied). Split by responsibility; prefer early returns. Genuinely
  irreducible cases (static tables, generated spec blocks) may carry
  `#[allow(clippy::too_many_lines)] // reason: …` rather than being fragmented.
- **Files ≤ 600 non-test lines** (counted before the first `#[cfg(test)]`). Over the cap → split
  into a `foo/{mod.rs, ...}` module directory, not by arbitrary line count.
- Rust **edition 2024**, rust-version **1.95**.

## Architecture North Star (governing — see `docs/designs/architecture-north-star.md`)

The long-term architecture and its invariants live in `docs/designs/architecture-north-star.md`.
**Read it before any structural change.** The rules below are binding:

- **Prime directive.** Every new capability enters through a **declared seam** (port / registry /
  protocol). Never open a bespoke entry point. (The off-protocol `nerve agent run` CLI is the
  cautionary counter-example: it bypassed the runtime protocol and is scheduled — roadmap P0 — to be
  folded back in as a `RuntimeCommand`.)
- **Determinism boundary.** `nerve-core` stays pure and golden-tested. No LLM / network / wall-clock /
  plugin code in the kernel — it lives in `nerve-runtime` / `nerve-agent` / `nerve-workstation`.
- **Single dispatch hub.** All tool execution goes through `Runtime` (`handle_tool_call*` /
  `handle_command*`); never call `nerve-core` dispatch directly from a host.
- **Single protocol authority.** The runtime protocol vocabulary is defined **only** in
  `nerve-runtime`, as transport-neutral data, codegen'd to TS and drift-checked; changes are additive
  and versioned. `nerve-runtime` never depends on `nerve-agent`; the binary translates protocol data
  ⇄ domain types. MCP (`server.rs`) is a *separate* external protocol — keep session/agent vocabulary
  out of it.
- **Extending the system — use the seam, don't fork an entry point:**

  | Adding… | Seam to use |
  |---|---|
  | A first-party tool | `RuntimeToolAdapter` (in `nerve-runtime`) |
  | External / third-party tools | an MCP-client `RuntimeToolAdapter` (consume MCP servers) |
  | A model provider | `nerve_agent::provider::LlmProvider` (+ config for OpenAI-compatible) |
  | A login flow | `nerve_agent::auth::AuthStrategy` |
  | A data source | `nerve_core::CatalogProvider` |
  | Agent capabilities | Skills / Agent-Def data (loaded, not compiled) |
  | A new client surface (GUI/TUI/mobile) | the versioned runtime protocol (never a new bespoke RPC) |

- **Roadmap priority:** P0 Session layer (fold the agent into the protocol) → P1 MCP client →
  P2 provider registry/config → P3 skills + agent/workflow defs → P4 permission engine →
  P5 persistence → P6 hooks + GUI/mobile.
